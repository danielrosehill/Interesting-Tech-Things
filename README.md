There has arguably never been a more exciting time in the world of technology!

Which also means that, like many, my list of Github stars is perpetually filling up far beyond the reaches of my abilities to check out the projects (no matter how much coffee I guzzle; and lately, that's been a lot!)

As I am fond of open sourcing just about everything and commonly have chats with other people interested in AI along the lines of."what things are you checking out?" (the question is always quickly reciprocated!), I thought I'd create a little notepad to attempt to bring order to my list. This is both for my own use and for anyone else who's curious.
