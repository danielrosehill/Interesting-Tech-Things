There is such a huge amount of Interesting technology to explore in the world of agents, orchestration and assistants that it's proving a long and arduous journey to familiarize myself with the full breadth of these tools, even superficially. I'm doing so out of the firm conviction that In 2025 and far beyond, these will be what enable the really exciting (and hopefully transformative) use-cases in AI.

Among the nooks and crannies of this sprawling ecosystem, I'm very interested in:

## Composio

Wonderful idea. As integrations come to life and move from aspiration to reality the glue to connect the services with LLMs will be indispensable.

## Letta (Statefulness For Agents)

Extremely interesting project (formerly MemGPT).

I'm waiting for the frontend to interact with this ecosystem to mature a little before spending too much time getting familiar with it (less out of an aversion to code and more out of the fact that, until agents are easy to navigate and use regardless of your device, they're not going to all that helpful to me)

But as a huge believer in the value of context, memory and personalization to deliver qualitativey different AI experiences for people (and not businesses!) this project speaks to me a lot.

## AutoGPT, BabyAGI

This project is involved in experiment but feels like "mandatory reading" For anyone wanting to think and get glimpses into what autonomous agents can (and will) really do. 

## Crew AI

Another "must explore" framework (I've made some initial attempts)

## Argo (Formerly Phi Data)

Another agentic project that I would be easier to dive deeper into if it were a little more accessible from the end use perspective. But very interesting.

## Glama.ai

It's becoming hard to keep track of all all the different and sometimes similar sounding tech products. I keep forgetting Glama's name but it seems very interesting as an MCP platform!
