## Middleware between data and vector DBs

A stack component that I've been looking for lately without much success is something to sit between data that might be gathered by user or organization and the vector databases where it ultimately gets embedded for direct calling by AI tools.

The reason I'm interested in such a tool is more from the standpoint of a tech philosophy than anything else: I don't like coupling long term plans too tightly to any one vendor's technology and think that separating between the data intake layer and the vector stores makes sense.

With different factor databases and embedding models promising a loss, it's going to become increasingly common for businesses to try out several before figuring out which works best for their particular data. This is another reason why I think that decoupling the aggregation layer from the storage will make sense.
