Things I'm already familiar with and using but am learning more about and see a bright future for:

## Open Interpreter

Extremely interesting project (ditto everything CUA related)

This was my first time seeing AI actually take control of my Linux computer beyond the scope of agentic IDE coding partners. 

I've been extremely impressed by this project and think that It would pair fantastically with a speech to text add on, thereby enabling users to control their computers with their voice in a way that wasn't arduous to configure.

## Firecrawl

Wonderful platform to facilitate the ingress of data required for context to work. A workhorse that is absolutely worth having in an LLM stack.

I used it lately to scrape some of my own form of writing from the Internet in order to fine tune a model on my own writing style. 

## Qdrant

Unless you have a PhD in statistics, then embeddings and vectors is where AI starts getting really complicated - and you begin to get a sense for the level of complication and sheer mathematics hat lies beneath the hood. 

I really like Qdrant because it's a robust open source vector database, that is. available both as a self installable open source product and as a Saas cloud offering (I like to migrate to SaaS once I know what I'm doing and so long as I can back up my data!)

I've noticed a significant leap in performance with context retrieval and Open Web UI since adding Qdrant to my stack.  

## Browser Use

Another highly impressive tool. Takes control of a web browser, quite literally. It will probably take a long time for everyone, including me, to wrap their head around the potential use cases.
